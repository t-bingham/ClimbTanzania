We are privileged to be able to access any and all climbing that is publicly available on CT. Some of this access has restrictions. All of this access can be revoked. Please follow the guidelines below.

Respect Property Access

Much of the rock along lake Victoria is accessed by crossing land owned by people if the rocks themselves are not within a person's property. Where climbers are trying to make new developments it is important to approach anyone whose land the rocks may be on and negotiate permission for permanent/partial access and carefully note any restrictions the land owner wishes to impose on access.

Where access is limited, this will be displayed on a crag and/or boulder's important information section.

Access can be revoked. Don't be the one who ruins access for the many.


Respect the Environment

Do not litter. 
Take photos, take memories, take ticks. 
Pack in pack out. 
Brush your ticks.
Brush the climb.
Keep noise to a minimum near houses and towns.
Respect the animals, we are guests, they live there and they can probably eat you.
Do not graffiti, nobody cares that you were there or what year except your followers.
DO NOT MODIFY ANY NATURAL FORMATION. Shouldn't even have to write these ones honestly...

Please read this page each time you come. Local ethics and access is liable to change.
