CT is a mission by Thomas Bingham to make information about climbing in Tanzania accessible and easily communicable by local climbers and landowners, ultimately, giving them the ability to create rules on accessibility and ethics. In addition, it will serve necessary information on boulder, sport, and traditional climbing in an easily accessible way.


We believe that the East Coast of Lake Victoria is a holiday climbing destination that should be uttered in the same sentence as the Rocklands. With a coastline of climbing to be developed with boulders and routes, along with deep water soloing potential within the lake, Mwanza, Simiyu, and Mara has it all.


Many thanks to all of those who have made this project possible.


Thomas' climbing began in 2013 in a local gym. He fought through many high school injuries climbing any chance he got between school, study, and other extra-curricular commitments. After high school, he moved to the South Island of New Zealand and after a couple of years of no climbing during early University, he continued to build his passion for the sport on the weird, bold, and confusing climbing of Castle Hill. He became fixated on establishing routes in some of the lesser-climbed areas of Castle Hill, often only to discover that they had been climbed back in the '80s by the climbers of the time. This is a big part of why he is building this database and website - to avoid losing prime rock climbing to the blanket of time.


A special shoutout to Climbing for a Reason for opening the doorways of the climbing wall to the future crushers in Tanzania, and the likes of Climb Angola for doing the same in other areas of Africa.
